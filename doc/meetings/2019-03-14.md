## Meeting Goal

Determine the goal(s) of the lnd_grpc project

## Participants

## Items for discussion

1. Which Python version?

Will: built with 3.7 but if there's demand, let's make it compatible with Python2?

Bitstein: >=3.6, Python2 EOL January 2020

2. asyncio?

gRPC is using threads for async.

We should have an async client, more research is needed.

3. SQL?

Lightning Labs is going to implement Prometheus integration

Can we make the packaging optional so that people don't need to install SQLAlchemy?

4. Rebalancing script?

Include the rebalancing script into the lnd_grpc library?

Namespace? lnd-python top-level, rebal, grpc, tests, and sql as second level

5. gRPC options we should consider ( https://grpc.io/grpc/cpp/group__grpc__arg__keys.html )

No clue, we should experiment.

6. Documentation

See how SQLAlchemy generates documentation

Only document things specific to the python library

Readthedocs with example

Python slate, there's a separate github repo for LND documentation

7. Testing

Automatically create a regtest environment and teardown

8. Contributing.md process

Let's grab a template

9. Repo governance / organization

Have a branch + pull request + 1 approver

Minimizing dependencies, copy python-bitcoinlib proxy rpc method into the library
